# Web components

## Prerequisites

- nvm installed

## Setup

- create .nvmrc and set the required node version (we use v20)
- run `nvm use` to use the required node version
- run `npx create-nx-workspace@latest --preset=web-components --appName=demo` to initialize Nx,
  it will create a new subdirectory with the name specified during initialization. 
  The subdirectory will contain the Nx project. Settings used:
  - Where would you like to create your workspace? · web-components
  - Which CI provider would you like to use? · skip
  - Would you like remote caching to make your build faster? · skip
- run `npm install @ngneat/spectator --save-dev`
- run `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/dom`

## Add carousel library

- run `npx nx g @nx/js:lib libs/carousel --publishable --importPath=@pukanito/carousel` from the 'web-components' directory to add a library. Settings used:
  - Which bundler would you like to use to build the library? Choose 'none' to skip build setup. · vite
  - Which linter would you like to use? · eslint
  - Which unit test runner would you like to use? · jest

Access the carousel code at: https://github.com/pukanito/web-components/tree/master/libs/carousel

## Demo

- Assume 'nvm' or a correct node version is installed (node version in .nvmrc)
- clone this repository
- run `nvm use` (if you have 'nvm' installed)
- run `npm ci`
- run `npx nx run demo:serve`
- browse 'http://localhost:4200'
- to stop the demo press ctrl-c.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve demo
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build demo
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project demo
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
